00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.640
Our world is made up of matter.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.540
And one way that we study matter is with chemistry.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.800
How we use that knowledge leads us to chemical
engineering.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.680
Chemical engineering is one of the broadest of the
engineering fields, focused not only on chemicals –

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.640
which make up everything – but also on
developing and designing plants and processes
for manufacturing chemicals.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.360
Now, let’s imagine we’ve come up with an
amazing new product that we have to create
through a chemical process.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.640
It could be some new kind of personal water
purifier, or makeup that lasts as long as you want
it to, or a revolutionary clothing material.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.640
Whatever it is, we’re going to have to go
through some steps before we all get rich.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.880
Once we’ve designed our product, we’ll need
to create a facility where we can make it.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.480
And in order to know how to do that, it
would help if you understand a little about
the history of chemical engineering.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:57.280
[Theme Music]

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.240
To begin, let’s dispel a common assumption:
that chemical engineering is simply chemistry
applied to engineering.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.700
Sure, there’s a lot of chemistry involved, but the
engineering side has a lot to do with answering
questions, like

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.900
“What can we do with these chemicals?
How can we make them?

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.040
Where can we go from here, and What are the
possibilities?”

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.740
Chemical engineering got its unofficial
start back around the time of the American
Revolutionary War.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.980
During the war, blockades were put up to stop
trade between the American colonies and Europe.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.740
France was especially affected by these blockades,
because America is where it got its supply of sodium
carbonate, also known as soda ash.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.720
At the time, soda ash was used for a whole
bunch of things, from cooking, to manufacturing
glass and paper, to making soap.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.280
Since France couldn’t get sodium carbonate
from its normal trade routes,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:50.840
the French Royal Academy offered up a prize in 1775
to anyone who could make sodium carbonate from
sodium chloride – which we know as common salt.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.940
It took about 15 years, but a French chemist
and physician named Nicolas Leblanc finally
figured out how to do it around 1789.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:07.260
His methods, now known as the Leblanc Process, first
heated sodium chloride with sulfuric acid to produce
sodium sulfate, which was called the salt cake.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.300
The salt cake was then mixed with crushed
limestone and coal, and fired.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.150
This left the combination of sodium carbonate
and calcium sulfide, also known as black ash.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.320
The final step separated the sodium carbonate
from the black ash by washing it with water,
which was then evaporated.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.860
We call this extraction process lixiviation.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.920
Leblanc’s process became the forerunner of
modern chemical manufacturing, and paved the
way for future chemical engineers to come.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.360
By 1791, he opened up a small factory in Saint
Denis and began large-scale production of soda ash.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.380
But his plant was soon taken over by revolutionaries
during the French Revolution, who also released his
trade secrets.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.720
While this process was revolutionary in its
own right, it was pretty bad for the environment.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.780
It produced a ton of waste that smelled rather
putrid.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.660
Since chemical processes can often have
nasty byproducts,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.760
governments can often pass pollution legislation,
especially around big cities and bodies of water.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.400
But none of this has stopped the chemical
industry from growing.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.540
In the late 19th century, British chemist
George Davis worked as an inspector for the
Alkali Act,

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.440
which was an early piece of environmental
legislation in response to the Leblanc process.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.360
The act required soda manufacturers to reduce
the amount of hydrochloric acid gas that they
released into the atmosphere.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.060
Around 1887, Davis gave a series of lectures
at the Manchester School of Technology.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.220
His talks formed the basis for his two-volume
Handbook of Chemical Engineering, which was
the first of its kind.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.720
There were already chemistry books written
for specific industries, like acid production
and brewing.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:43.980
But what made Davis’ work unique was that it organized
basic operations that are common to many industries,
like transporting liquids and gases or distillation.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.280
In the US, his work helped stimulate new ways
of thinking about chemical processes

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.720
and sparked the creation of chemical engineering
degrees at universities around the country.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.240
Any chemical engineers that we work with to
help develop our product will likely have their
education rooted in Davis’ teachings.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.400
Around the turn of the 20th century, cars
were starting to become a regular part of
modern life.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.360
And soon chemical engineers were playing an
important role in their use, by making gasoline.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.240
Drills were already finding crude oil, but
that’s not gasoline.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.640
The oil needed to be refined.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.580
So we needed refineries, which were basically
giant chemical plants.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.440
Chemical engineers improved the process of
making gasoline by introducing methods like
cracking,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.700
where heavy hydrocarbon molecules
are broken down into lighter molecules by
heat and pressure.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.400
They also implemented the process of polymerization,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.600
where propylene and butylene are combined
into molecules of two or three times their
original molecular weight.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.240
With these improvements, gasoline became
more economically viable, which made gas cheaper
and owning a car less expensive.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.900
Now, large-scale chemical production like
this requires a lot of planning.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.540
So, as chemical plants develop, a big part
of chemical engineering becomes what we’ll
call “Unit Operations”.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:05:00.780
This was first introduced by the American
Arthur D. Little in 1915, and it breaks down each
part of a chemical plant into individual units.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.260
Do you need to get chemicals flowing from
one side of the plant to the other?

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.340
Use pipes.
That’s a unit.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.540
And you’ll need pumps to drive the flow.
That’s another unit.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.100
Need to stimulate a reaction?
Use a reactor.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.180
Want to mix those chemicals together?
Go for a mixer.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.560
Need to separate them?

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.070
Try distillation columns or maybe reverse
osmosis membranes.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.620
All of these are units, and they highlight
the key theories that chemical engineers need
to understand to keep a plant running.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.080
It’s important to think of processes as
a whole,

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.160
but it will be just as important to break down
our chemical plant into unit operations when we
get to the manufacturing phase.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.960
Once engineers realized – in part thanks to
Little’s work –

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:44.660
that all of these unit operations were founded
on basic principles, such as momentum transfer,
mass transfer, and thermodynamics,

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.200
they could then become more creative in
how they manufactured chemicals.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.860
They no longer had to use the same equipment
for the same limited purposes.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.340
Instead, they could devise new ways of using
their tools and machines.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.080
This allowed chemical engineering to grow
into one of the broadest engineering fields.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.020
As recently as the 1970’s, the field was
much more narrow than it is now.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:09.320
Back then, around 80% of graduating
chemical engineers took jobs in the chemical
process industry and government.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.080
By 2000, that 80% had dropped to about 50%.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.660
One of the reasons for this was the emergence
of biotechnology.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:22.780
Heavily focused on research and development,
biotechnology engineering applies technology
to biological systems and living organisms.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:30.600
Once we know how and why biological processes
work, we can find ways to change, adapt, and control
them, with the aim of making our lives better.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:37.240
In a similar fashion, pharmaceutical and
healthcare companies also played a big role in
expanding what chemical engineers do.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.240
Every day, new drugs and medicines are made
and improved upon.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.740
Chemical engineers also work on how best to
deliver these drugs into our bodies.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.760
Some might best be injected, like insulin
or an epipen, while others work well in a
spray form, like an inhaler.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.860
A lot of chemical engineering goes into many
of the foods that we eat as well.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:59.240
We’ve had to figure out such dark magic
as getting corn syrup from corn and making
artificial sweeteners.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:06.060
We’ve found dairy substitutes and used plants
to make vegan and vegetarian meats that taste
like they came from an animal – kind of.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.460
This has all done wonders for people with
food allergies and dietary restrictions.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.740
There’s also a growing focus on the
environment and sustainable energy within
the field of chemical engineering.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.460
We want to both preserve what we already have
and find energy sources that won’t run out of power.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:26.180
So one source that’s closely related to chemical
engineering is biomass: renewable organic material
that comes from plants and animals.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.480
This ranges from wood and leftover crops,
to garbage and manure.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:36.040
As of 2016, biomass fuels provide about 5%
of the primary energy used in the United States.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:42.760
And chemical engineers play a big part in
figuring out what can be used as biomass and how
to best break it down to get energy from it.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:49.300
All of these developments in chemical engineering
are what will really give us the knowledge to make
our wonderful new product, whatever it is.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.380
We can improve upon what’s already there,
or make something truly revolutionary.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.320
When you’re a creator, the possibilities
are endless.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.980
So today we learned a lot about the history
of chemical engineering, starting with its
origins in sodium carbonate.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.100
We then talked about George Davis, the father
of chemical engineering, and his teachings.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.120
We moved on to oil refineries and chemical
factories, learning about the unit operations
behind them.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:18.660
We ended our lesson by talking about the newer
and emerging fields of biotechnology, pharmaceuticals
and food, and finally renewable energy.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.200
Next time we’ll learn about industrial and
biomedical engineering and how they’re
changing the world.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.680
