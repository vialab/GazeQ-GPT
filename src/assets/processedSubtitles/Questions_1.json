        "choiceB": "He established the concept of \"Unit Operations\" to streamline and optimize chemical plant processes.",
        "choiceC": "He developed the Leblanc Process for producing sodium carbonate from sodium chloride.",
        "choiceD": "He advocated for the use of biomass as a renewable energy source to provide sustainable energy solutions.",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": {
            "A": "Option \"A\" is incorrect because Arthur D. Little did not create methods for refining crude oil into gasoline; this process was developed by other chemical engineers.",
            "B": "Option \"B\" is correct because Arthur D. Little first introduced the concept of \"Unit Operations\" in chemical engineering in 1915, which involves breaking down each part of a chemical plant into individual units to streamline and optimize processes.",
            "C": "Option \"C\" is incorrect because the Leblanc Process for producing sodium carbonate from sodium chloride was developed by Nicolas Leblanc, not Arthur D. Little",
            "D": "Option \"D\" is incorrect because although chemical engineers do play a significant role in biomass and renewable energy, Arthur D. Little did not specifically advocate for biomass as a sustainable energy source"

        "choiceD": "They played a vital role in the creation of unit operations for industrial chemical processes.",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": {
            "A": "Option \"A\" is correct because chemical engineers play a significant role in preserving existing resources and discovering new sustainable energy solutions, specifically through the development and utilization of biomass as a renewable energy source",
            "B": "Option \"B\" is incorrect because it describes the role of chemical engineers in developing processes like cracking and polymerization to produce gasoline in oil refineries, rather than focusing on renewable energy sources like biomass.",
            "C": "Option \"C\" is incorrect because it describes chemical engineers' involvement in biotechnology by applying technology to biological systems and living organisms, focusing on research and development, rather than the development of biomass as a renewable energy source.",
            "D": "Option \"D\" is incorrect because it highlights the creation of unit operations by Arthur D. Little to streamline industrial chemical processes, which is not directly related to the development of biomass as a renewable energy source."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": {
            "A": "Option A is correct because George Davisâ€™ lectures, which formed the basis for his \"Handbook of Chemical Engineering,\" organized basic operations common to many industries and sparked the creation of chemical engineering degrees at universities in the US",
            "B": "Option B is incorrect because the concept of unit operations was introduced by Arthur D. Little in 1915, not by George Davis",
            "C": "Option C is incorrect because advancements in drug delivery systems and medical treatments are linked to the expansion of the chemical engineering field due to biotechnology and pharmaceutical developments, not specifically to George Davis",
            "D": "Option D is incorrect because methods like cracking and polymerization to improve gasoline production were developed by chemical engineers other than George Davis"
