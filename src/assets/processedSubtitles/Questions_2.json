        "choiceA": "The challenge was primarily about determining the most efficient method of producing electrical power to maximize output and minimize costs.",
        "choiceB": "The conflict centered on the debate between whether direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) would become the standard for electrical power transmission.",
        "choiceC": "The main contention was over the safety of electrical power, with major advocates on each side presenting their methods as the safer option for public adoption.",
        "choiceD": "It was a dispute over the technological superiority of electrical transmission methods, with a focus on which could support longer-distance transmission without significant power loss.",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": {
            "A": "Option A is incorrect because the conflict was not about the production efficiency of electricity but rather the mode of its delivery to consumers.",
            "B": "Option B is correct because the key issue was whether to use a system that sends electricity in a single direction or one that reverses direction periodically for power distribution.",
            "C": "Option C is incorrect because while safety concerns were highlighted, the core of the debate revolved around the technical format for distributing electricity, not its safety implications.",
            "D": "Option D is incorrect because the argument was not primarily focused on the capacity for long-range conveyance without loss, but rather on the foundational system for delivering electric service."
